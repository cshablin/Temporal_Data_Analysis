important for quiz 2 - IEClassifier, GAIN, normalizing term frequency

TD4C- optimized cutoffs to create max difference in distribution between each of the levels between classes (greater discriminability). 
TD4C similar to persist (in terms of cutoff determination - greedy) 

BIDE - criteria is whether the pattern is discriminative between classes (feature selection performed on the fly and the tree is pruned prematurely)
