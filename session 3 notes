PAA can be used to convert univariate to multivariate (take mean, med, etc)

- EWD , EFD

(CHI) Persist - identifies tiem intervals that are the longest
              - greedily search for a matrix having max prob in the diagonal (staying in the same state) as compared to state transition probabilities to other states.
              
              - Symmetric Kulback Leibler (SKL) divergence is the metric used for comparing probability transitions.
              - persistence = see ppt
              - overall persistence score is the average (over all symbols) persistence of each symbol.

Slideset 2

(CHI) - Sequential mining - in which events have no duration. Only relevant relations are BEFORE and EQUAL.
- first few slides until Apriori Algo are imp for fundamental understanding of association rule mining
