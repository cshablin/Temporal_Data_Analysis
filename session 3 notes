PAA can be used to convert univariate to multivariate (take mean, med, etc)

- EWD , EFD

(CHI) Persist - identifies tiem intervals that are the longest
              - greedily search for a matrix having max prob in the diagonal (staying in the same state) as compared to state transition probabilities to other states.
              
              - Symmetric Kulback Leibler (SKL) divergence is the metric used for comparing probability transitions.
              - persistence = see ppt
              - overall persistence score is the average (over all symbols) persistence of each symbol.

Slideset 2

(CHI) - Sequential mining - in which events have no duration. Only relevant relations are BEFORE and EQUAL.
- first few slides until Apriori Algo are imp for fundamental understanding of association rule mining
- methods to improve apriori's efficiency - Imp slide
- subsequence vs super sequence
-slide of import - "What is Sequential Pattern Mining?"
-- Support and relative support
- slide of import - "Challenges in Sequential Pattern Mining"
- slide 23 important. 
-- reduced to 51 candidates instead of the 92 that would have been generated by the apriori algo. (improvement on the apriori algo - apriori pruning (but is still inefficient singce it scans the db multiple times)
- slide 25 - the GSP mining process explained
- Spade algorithm - slide 28
