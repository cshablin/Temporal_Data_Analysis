Slideset - Sequential Mining

-PrefixSpan
-- prefixspan is more efficient memorywise (when compared to spade)
-- to find all the frequent sequential patterns (given a minimum support)
-- akin to a multi-level hash map (dict) with connected sequences at each level followed by min support hash maps of each of the individual characters
-- there is no candidate generation

-Closed Patterns
-- ?!

LIT SURV : 

-domain of problem
-methods used
- have a nice split.

QUIZ - is basic.



Slideset - Time Intervals Mining

- go through slides. Too much info to condense into notes.

- in general, you may want to try out different time windows for prediction time windows. ( even for anomaly detection - in anomaly detection - take a time period and flag if a record in it is found to be anomalous)
- use as features some TIRPs. (in the case of classification) - tirps can be binary (do they exist or not), they can also be used from the perspective of frequencies of occurrence.
- Allen's temporal logic - 
- slide 12 VIMP.
-kam & fu , DaWaK 2000 - they also use Allen's temporal logic
 -- here, one pattern is represented in many ways - but choose the one that presents the least amount of ambiguity.
