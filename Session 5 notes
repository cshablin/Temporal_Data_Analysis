 -- freska - a lookup table that provides the disjunction of 2 relations. Given A and B , Given B and C, use lookup table to get the disjunction between A and C
 -- if we don't use horizontal support, we don't get completeness. 
 -- discovery of all the horizontally supporting instances of a tirp is essential for completeness. - eg  - if a specific patient (entity) gets a specific pattern multiple times and all other patients get the pattern only once, then maybe it's worth checking it out.
 
 -- issue with tirps time intervals duration ambiguity - reduces the frequency of occurrence when you split based on the durations. A` A`` A```
